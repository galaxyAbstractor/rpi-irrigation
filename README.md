Very WIP

New version for automatically watering some plants.

Powered by a Raspberry Pi with the official 7" touchscreen, react and electron.

[Using two of these IKEA units](https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/krydda-odlingsenhet-2-nivaer-svart-foerzinkad-10318442/).

One pump, 4 valves to be able to water each bed separately.
